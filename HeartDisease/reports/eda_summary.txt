Histograms: age shows a roughly normal distribution skewed slightly older; chol and oldpeak show right skew.
Boxplots: chol and oldpeak contain clear high-value outliers worth checking before imputation.
Q-Q plots: chol deviates from normal in the right tail; oldpeak shows substantial non-normality.
Correlation heatmap: thalach and age show moderate correlation patterns with target; check exact values in heatmap.
Countplots: class imbalance visible if one target class dominates; also validate sex and cp distributions.
Pairplot: relationships between age, thalach, and oldpeak differ between target classes (inspect saved figure).

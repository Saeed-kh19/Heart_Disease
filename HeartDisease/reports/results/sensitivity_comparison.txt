Comparison between VariantA_mean_minmax and VariantB_median_standard: on the reserved test sets VariantA_mean_minmax achieved test F1 = 0.9707 (K=3) while VariantB_median_standard achieved test F1 = 0.9484 (K=3). Cross-validation at the chosen K showed mean CV F1 (std) = 0.9541 (0.0266) for VariantA_mean_minmax and 0.9561 (0.0218) for VariantB_median_standard. Based on test F1 and CV stability, prefer the variant with higher test F1 and lower CV std, unless clinical interpretability or simplicity suggests otherwise.
